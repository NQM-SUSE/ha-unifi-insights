"""
Derive a stable identity for the console a config entry talks to.

The config flow and ``async_setup_entry`` both have to answer the same two
questions - which of the Network devices *is* this console, and what should
identify it - but they used to answer them separately and drifted apart. The
flow ignored ``is_gateway``, inspected only the first site's devices, and
treated a ``"default"`` site id differently from setup. Setup could therefore
adopt a MAC the flow was unable to derive, leaving the flow with a host-based
``unique_id`` that ``_abort_if_unique_id_configured()`` no longer matched, so
re-adding one console created a second config entry.

Keeping both callers on these helpers is what stops that drift returning. The
functions take plain dicts because the two callers hold different shapes:
setup reads coordinator data, while the flow dumps its API models with
``model_dump(by_alias=True)``.
